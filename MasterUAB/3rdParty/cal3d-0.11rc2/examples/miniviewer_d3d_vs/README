Attention, you need a recent version of Cal3D 
if you want to compile the program, you can find it on the cvs.

| 2 What is 'cal3d-miniviewer vs' D3D version ?                               |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
  
  cal3d-miniviewer vs is a modified version of the cal3d-miniviewer, this 
  version use vertex shader to render models so the performance depend only
  on the gpu and not to Cal3D because Cal3D don't do any calculation expensive
  task. But the springs system are disabled because it can be do in vertex shader.
  This is possible to mix vertex shader and cal3d normal code, but this program
  don't do this yet.

  The miniviewer tool is started from a shell with the following arguments:

  cal3d_miniviewer_vs [--fullscreen]              : run in fullscreen mode
                      [--window]                  : run in window mode
                      [--dimension width height]  : dimension of the window
                      [--help]                    : show this usage info
                   model-configuration-file    : the model definition file
  if you want to have the debug informations:
  cal3d_miniviewer_vs ... > debug.txt

| 4 Model Configuration File                                                  |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  The model configuration file contains the definition of a model. This
  includes paths to one skeleton, one or more animation, mesh and material
  files.

  The whole file consists of comment lines that start with a leading '#'
  character or lines with a 'key=value' pair. Here is a list of the possible
  keys:

  path=...       : a relative path to the data files below
  scale=...      : a scale factor that is used to fit the model to the screen
  skeleton=...   : a cal3d skeleton file
  animation=...  : a cal3d animation file
  mesh=...       : a cal3d mesh file
  material=...   : a cal3d material file

  There should only be one skeleton line in the file. If you define multiple
  animations they will be executed one after another.

  You need a hardware accelerated 3d graphic card (with Directx 9 driver) to
  get a decent framerate.
  if you want best performance, a full dx 8 is needed so vertex shader can
  be executed in hardware but this is not required to run the program.
