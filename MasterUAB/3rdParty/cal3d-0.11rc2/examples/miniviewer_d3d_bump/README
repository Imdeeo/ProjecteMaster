Attention, you need a recent version of Cal3D (after juillet 30, 2003) 
if you want to compile the program, you can find it on the cvs.

| 2 What is "Cal3d miniviewer D3D9 version with bumpmapping" ?                |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  Cal3d miniviewer D3D9 version with bumpmapping is a simple model viewer tool 
  that renders animated models as the normal miniviewer, but the render of
  this version can also do Bump mapping.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| 3 Usage                                                                     |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  The miniviewer tool is started from a shell with the following arguments:

  cal3d_miniviewer [--fullscreen]              : run in fullscreen mode
                   [--window]                  : run in window mode
                   [--nobump]                  : disable bump mapping
                   [--dimension width height]  : dimension of the window
                   [--help]                    : show this usage info
                   model-configuration-file    : the model definition file
  if you want to have the debug informations:
  cal3d_miniviewer ... > debug.txt  


o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| 4 Model Configuration File                                                  |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  The model configuration file contains the definition of a model. This
  includes paths to one skeleton, one or more animation, mesh and material
  files.

  The whole file consists of comment lines that start with a leading '#'
  character or lines with a 'key=value' pair. Here is a list of the possible
  keys:

  path=...       : a relative path to the data files below
  scale=...      : a scale factor that is used to fit the model to the screen
  skeleton=...   : a cal3d skeleton file
  animation=...  : a cal3d animation file
  mesh=...       : a cal3d mesh file
  material=...   : a cal3d material file

  There should only be one skeleton line in the file. If you define multiple
  animations they will be executed one after another.

| 5 How can I use Bump mapping ?                                              |
o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

   It is easy to setup Bump mapping on a character:
   When you use 3DSMax, you have just to add a Bump Mapping texture.
   After there is only two requirements :
      - You need to convert the heightmap into a normal map 
        (you will find plugin to do this)
      - You need to have "bump" in the filename of the bumpmapping texture

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  You need a hardware accelerated 3d graphic card (with Directx 9 support) to
  get a decent framerate.
  But for bump mapping you need a 3d card that have the DOT3 extension
  (Geforce/Radeon can do this)
  It also better if your card can use vertex shader in hardware.
