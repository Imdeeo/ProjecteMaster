Build System Dependencies
-------------------------

   To configure and build the Cally demo, you need the following tools:
   
   GNU Autoconf 2.13 or newer
   GNU Automake 1.4 or newer

   The source packages can be found at:

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake



------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

   The miniviewer uses GNU's autobuild tools in order to allow users to 
build the library from source using the same methods on a wide variety of 
platforms.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. In the top-level directory of the cal3d_cally package, run 
     `autoreconf --install --force' to automatically generate the 
     configuration scripting files.
 
  2. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system. 

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for. See below for
     more info on configuring the Cal3D miniviewer.

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the application into
     the appropriate location.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  


   The `autoreconf' script will run the autotools for you and create
the configure script and Makefile.in files, which will be used during 
the build process.
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').


---------------------------------
Some Useful Configuration Options
---------------------------------

   When using the `configure' script, you might want to use some of the 
optional flags to change various aspects of the build and installation.
Below are some of the most commonly-used options.


   --with-cal3d=<DIR>      Specify the location where you've installed the
                           Cal3d package. This should be the parent directory
                           of /lib and /include.

   --prefix=<DIR>          Sets the package to be installed in a particular
                           location. By default, Cal3D is installed to
                           /usr/local

   --with-cxx=<COMPILER>   Forces the use of a particular compiler. By default,
                           the CXX environment variable is used.
                           


   To get a list of all configuration options that the script supports, type
`./configure --help'.
