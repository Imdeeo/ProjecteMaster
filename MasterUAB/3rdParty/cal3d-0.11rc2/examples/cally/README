  2.1 What is 'The Cally Demo'?

      'The Cally Demo' is an interactive demonstration of the 3d character
      animation library Cal3D.

  2.2 Features

      - different segmented, textured, animated and skinned models
      - interactive realtime blending of multiple skeletal animation tracks
      - correct lightning (the mesh normals are *skinned* too)
      - bone, wireframe, flat-shaded or lit rendering of the model
      - interactive realtime LOD (level-of-detail)

  2.3 Requirements

      You need a hardware accelerated 3d graphic card to get a decent
      framerate.

  2.4 Website

      The official website of Cal3D and this demo can be found at:
      http://cal3d.sourceforge.net

  2.5 Authors

  3.1 Commandline arguments

      '--window' starts the demo in a window.

      '--fullscreen' starts the demo in fullscreen mode.

      '--dimension <width> <height>' sets the width and height of the window
      or fullscreen mode.

      '--data <path>' sets the directory where the cal3d_data module is
      located.

  3.2 Mouse control

      Click&drag the left mouse-button to rotate the model. Click&drag the
      right mouse-button up and down to zoom in and out.

  3.3 Menu

      The 'Idle' button brings the model into the default pose. 'Funky' will
      start a longer, special animation. The 'Motion' button enables the motion
      triangle that lets you interactively blend 3 different animation cycles.
      Click&drag the left mouse-button in the triangle to modify the weights.
      'F/X 1' and 'F/X 2' execute an overlay animation.

      The 'Bone' button toggles the bone rendering mode. The 'Wireframe' button
      does the same for the wireframe mode. The 'Bulp' button toggles the
      lightning on and off. The remaining button will switch to the next model.

      The 'LOD' slider can be used to adjust the level-of-detail of the model.
      100% will render all available faces, 0% will skip all collapsable ones.

  3.4 Hotkeys

      You can quit the demo by pressing 'q' or 'escape'.
