  The Cal3D library is licensed under the LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public
  License) which, among other things, allows you to link proprietary
  applications with it. The Cal3D team strongly believes in the Free Software
  movement and provides this library without any additional restrictions.
  However, to make this a "fair deal" and to support the future development of
  the library, we ask you to follow these points when using the Cal3D library
  in your projects:

    - Seriously consider releasing you project under a free license yourself.
    - Read and understand the LGPL and make sure that your usage of Cal3D
      complies with it.
    - Include a prominent mention about the usage of the Cal3D library in
      your project.
    - Send a short message to us when you release your work.
    - Provide feedback to the Cal3D project to help us enhance it.
    - If you make millions with your project, donate some bucks to the Cal3D
      project to fund the future development =)

  Furthermore, here are a few other possibilities to help the Cal3D project:

    - The Cal3D is always in need of models, animations, textures and demos.
      So, if you have something to spare, send it along!
    - Sponsoring and donations can definitively help the project, just
      contact us.
    - Have you heard of a new animation technology? Is there a freshly
      written, earth-shaking paper about inverse-kinematics on your desk?
      Fell free to send it to the Cal3D project, so we can put it into the
      library!

  The Cal3D team thanks you for your support and wishes you success with all
  your projects!

| 3 What is 'cal3d'?                                                          |

  Cal3D is a skeletal based character animation library. It is platform-
  independent and not bound to a specific graphic API. Originally designed to
  be used in a 3d client for the Worldforge project ( www.worldforge.org )
  it evolved into a stand-alone product that can be used in many different
  projects.

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  - skeletal based animation setup
  - seamless blending of multiple animation tracks
  - attachment and detachment of one or more skinned meshes at runtime
  - transformation of vertices and normals according to the weighted influence
    of one or more bones
  - flexible material handling
  - support for multiple texture mapping channels
  - progressive meshes for LOD (level-of-detail)
  - binary and text file formats
  - experimental spring-system module for cloth and hair animation
  - unified exporter plugin framework (3D Studio Max, MilkShape 3D and others
    following)
  - highly portable and modular design (only depends on C++ and STL)
  - simple and clean API (both in C++ and "pure" C)
  - did I mention that it is free? (see the LGPL license)

o-----------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  There are no special requirements to compile/use cal3d. A C++ compiler with
  (decent) STL support should be enough.
